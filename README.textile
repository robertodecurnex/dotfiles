h1. My dotfiles

h2. Warnings!

Some files will be deleted!
Still working on this, I will add backup support soon.

h2. How it works

The instalation will pick every file within the _*targets*_ directory and create symlinks (after delete the original files) within the home analog directory. 

In order to allow the creation of config files within child directories, without deleting the parent one, _*_*_ can be used as prefix of the dirctory name (see "examples":#examples). 

h2. Usage

# clone the repo on your home directory
# move into the repo's directory
# run rake install

h2. Examples

TBA
